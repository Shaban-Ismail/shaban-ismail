								<p>what is IoT and cyber security?</p>
								<p>IoT stands for Internet of Things, which refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items that are embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity to enable them to collect and exchange data over the internet. IoT has many applications in various fields, including healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, and agriculture.

									<br><br>Cybersecurity, on the other hand, refers to the protection of computer systems, networks, and digital assets from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption. Cybersecurity is crucial in the IoT space, as the increased connectivity and data exchange among IoT devices create more opportunities for cyber threats and attacks.
									
									<br><br>Ensuring the security of IoT devices requires a multi-layered approach that includes secure hardware design, secure software development, strong authentication mechanisms, data encryption, and continuous monitoring and threat detection. With the proper cybersecurity measures in place, IoT devices can deliver their intended benefits while minimizing the risks associated with cyber attacks.</p>
									<br><br><p>why do we need IoT and cyber security?</p>
									<p>We need IoT because it has the potential to transform various industries, improve efficiency, and enhance our quality of life. IoT devices can collect and exchange data in real-time, enabling better decision-making, automation of processes, and improved communication between devices and people. For example, IoT devices can be used in healthcare to monitor patients remotely, in agriculture to optimize irrigation and fertilization, and in transportation to improve traffic flow and reduce accidents.

										<br><br>However, the increased connectivity and data exchange among IoT devices also create new cyber threats and risks. Cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities in IoT devices to steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, or even cause physical harm. For example, an attacker could hack into a medical device and modify the dosage of a patient's medication, or hijack a self-driving car and cause a crash.
										
										<br><br>Therefore, cybersecurity is essential in the IoT space to protect the privacy, safety, and integrity of IoT devices and the data they collect and exchange. Cybersecurity measures such as strong authentication, encryption, and continuous monitoring can help mitigate the risks associated with cyber threats and ensure the safe and reliable operation of IoT devices. Without proper cybersecurity, the potential benefits of IoT may be outweighed by the risks and harm caused by cyber attacks.</p>

								<h3 class="major">1.1:ipconfig</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/scan1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/scan11.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>ipconfig is a command-line tool used to display the current configuration of network interfaces on a Windows operating system. 
								When executed without any parameters, it displays basic information about the currently active network interfaces, such as the IP address, 
								subnet mask, and default gateway.</p><br><br>

								<h3 class="major">1.2:ipconfig all</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/scan2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/scan22.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/scan222.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>ipconfig /all displays detailed information about all network interfaces, including those that are not currently active. 
								This includes the MAC address, DHCP server address, DNS server address, and other configuration details.</p>
								<br><h2 align="center">the difference between ipconfig and ipconfig all</h2>
								<br><br><p>the difference between ipconfig and ipconfig /all is that the former only displays basic information about the active network interfaces, while the latter displays detailed information about all network interfaces, 
								including those that are not currently active.</p><br><br>

								<h3 class="major">1.3:tracert</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/tracert1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									there were over a maximum of 30 hops<br>
									Based on the provided output, it appears that the biggest delay in the route occurs between the 5th and 6th steps,
									where the round-trip time (RTT) increases from 421 ms to 142 ms. 
									This suggests that there may be some congestion or other network issues at the point where the traffic transitions from the Turkish provider TurkTelekom to the global provider Telia.
									<br>
									The average duration of that delay can be calculated by subtracting the RTT of the 5th step from the RTT of the 6th step. 
									This gives a difference of 142 ms - 421 ms = -279 ms. However, this negative number is not a valid duration and suggests that there may be some inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the provided data. Therefore, 
									it is difficult to determine the average duration of the delay with certainty based on the provided output alone.

								</p><br><br>
								
								<h3 class="major">1.4:nslookup</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/nslookup.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Based on the output of the nslookup command, the main nameserver for the website www.a2hosting.com is not clear. 
									The output shows that the DNS request timed out, which means that the nameserver could not be determined.
									<br>
									It is possible that there was a temporary issue with the DNS server, or there could be a problem with the network connection. 
								</p><br><br>

								<center><h2>refliction</h2></center>
								<p>
									overall, i did not have any issue with the ipconfig and ipconfig/all both worked well,
									the first one displayes the IP address, subnet and default gateway for the active network intrfaces.<br>
									the second one displayes all the information about the active network interfaces also those that are not active.<br>
									i had an issue with tracert which is i wrote it wrong in the beggening then i rewrite it and it displayes everything 
									well,it displayed a series of data packets to the IP address associated with the domain name www.a2hosting.com,
									and each intermediate router along the way will send back a response that includes information about its address and how long it took for the packet to travel there.<br>
									the last thing was the NSLOOKUP, everything displayed well such as the IP addresses except the DNS, The output shows that the DNS request timed out, which means that the nameserver could not be determined.
									It is possible that there was a temporary issue with the DNS server, or there could be a problem with the network connection.

								Pentbox is used to test the security of a network by simulating various types of attacks. 
								It can help security professionals identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in their network 
								and take steps to address them before they can be exploited by attackers.<br>
								While a honeypot is a tool used to detect and deflect attempts at unauthorized access or intrusion.<br>
								and that is what i did in the screenshoots above i installled the pentbox then i used network tools to 
								use the honeypot, and i inserted the port which is 443 and wrote the false message to show,

									DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are used to disrupt the normal functioning of a website,
									server, or network by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. 
									The goal of a DDoS attack is to make a system or service unavailable to legitimate users by consuming its resources and bandwidth.<br>
									as the screenshoots shows i used the msfconsole then i inserted the the target host that i got from the command prompt
									by using ping, also the target port which was 80, then i ran it and we can see the result in the wireshark 
									which is overwhelming the target host until it shutted down.
